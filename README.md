# <Jose Dominguez Portfolio>
## Description
This is my portfolio that I am using to house my projects, resume, and contact information for employers and anyone who wants to see what I'm up to.

During this project I learned a lot about proper html orientation and how to effectively use flex box and media queries to create an accessible and responsive web page.
