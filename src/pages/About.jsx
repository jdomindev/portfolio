              Hey! My name is Jose Dominguez, my focus is being an energetic
              problem-solver and hard working team member to design and build
              high quality functional apps.

              <p className="about-text">
                My dev journey began through a full-stack coding bootcamp where my
                passion for technology was kindled. With my expanded skill set and eagerness to learn, I have been leading on a multitude of projects that now help
                organizations leverage their data for social good. My diverse
                background in government, non-profit, and consulting work gives me
                unique insight into applying different perspectives to solve
                business problems.
              </p>
              <p className="about-text">
                When Iâ€™m not busy coding, my interests include playing guitar,
                building vivariums, and playing video games. I am also fascinated
                with computer hardware and have built and troubleshooted several PCs for
                friends and family. I also enjoy going herping at my local and
                state parks when I have the chance.
