                <p>
                  Hey! My name is Jose, and I have had a lifelong passion for
                  computers. Growing up, I always found a way to be on a
                  computer, whether it was designing my own sites in Piczo or
                  playing click-and-point puzzle games. Today, my mission is to
                  design and build high quality functional apps that help make
                  people's lives easier. In 2021, I expanded my skill set
                  through a full-stack coding bootcamp, which is where my web
                  development journey began.
                </p>
                <br></br>
                <p>
                  Since then, I have been leading on a multitude of projects
                  that help organizations leverage their data for social good.
                  My diverse background in government, non-profit, and
                  consulting work gives me unique insight into applying
                  different perspectives to solve business problems.
                </p>
