              Hey! My name is Jose, my focus is being an energetic
              problem-solver and hard working team member to design and build
              high quality functional apps.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
              My dev journey began through a full-stack coding bootcamp where my
              passion for technology was kindled. With my expanded skill set and eagerness to learn, I have been leading on a multitude of projects that now help
              organizations leverage their data for social good. My diverse
              background in government, non-profit, and consulting work gives me
              unique insight into applying different perspectives to solve
              business problems.
            </p>
            <p className="about-text">
              When Iâ€™m not busy coding, my interests include playing guitar,
              building vivariums, and playing video games.I am also fascinated
              with PC hardware and have built and troubleshooted several PCs for
              friends and family. I also enjoy going herping at my local and
              state parks when I have the chance.
